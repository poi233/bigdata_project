In the 21st century, more women work, pay Social security taxes and earn credit toward their own monthly retirement income than in any other time in our nation's history. Women tend to care for many people including spouses, children and parents.  Women are more likely to earn less over their lifetimes than men.  Women are less often covered by private retirement plans and more dependent on Social Security- and for a longer period of time since, on average, women live about five years longer than men. When women work, they pay taxes into the Social Security system, providing their own benefits. Women who do not work are often covered through their husbands' work and can receive benefits based on their current husband or prior husband's work record when they retire, become disabled or die. Women should remember to contact Social Security to correct the information Social Security has for them, if they change their name through divorce or marriage", "Our Community Education Program offers interactive, law-based workshops that educate youth in public school classes, after-school programs and foster care group homes; we train social service providers, teachers and parents on domestic violence and the law.

In January 2005, Mayor Bloomberg created the Office of Industrial and Manufacturing Businesses to retain and grow the sector's job base, execute the goals of the industrial policy, and serve as a single point of coordination for the industrial and manufacturing sector. The sector provides close to 500,000 jobs in New York City, making up nearly 15% of the city's workforce, and contributed $1.7 billion in tax revenues in 2004. The manufacturing and industrial sector is not only a strong component of our economy but a reliable source of jobs for many of our fellow New Yorkers. More than half of the employees in the industrial sector have a high school diploma or less and nearly a fifth have limited English proficiency. New York City is a strategic location to operate an industrial business. The unparalleled concentration of residents, businesses, economic activity, and wealth creates a tremendous end market for the industrial sector. Every employer praises the New York City workforce for its unparalleled diversity, depth of talent, commitment, and proactive attitude. Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the sector. Space to expand or relocate is expensive and scarce, operating costs are high, and there is a perception that the overall business environment presents obstacles. Our Office has begun to address these issues. Our Office broadened the Commercial Expansion Program to create benefits especially for industrial and manufacturing businesses that rent their spaces. In early 2006 our Office created 16 Industrial Business Zones across the City where expanded business services are available for industrial and manufacturing businesses. A relocation tax credit of $1,000 per employee is offered for manufacturing and industrial businesses that choose to relocate within the Industrial Business Zones.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Moreover, the zones represent areas where the Bloomberg Administration guarantees it will prohibit any new residential development. And State tax credits are also available to qualified businesses located in certain Industrial Business Zones as a result of the recent reconfiguration of the New York City's Empire Zones. Our Office intends to see these initiatives grow and better serve the city\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds industrial and manufacturing businesses. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more.

Since that date, Medical Examiners at OCME have held faculty positions in NYU's Forensic Medicine department.

In 1960, OCME's six-story headquarters at 520 First Avenue (northeast corner of First Avenue and 30th Street) opened on land provided by New York University, adjacent to NYU Medical Center. In 1968 the Institute of Forensic Medicine of New York University and the City of New York was created; in 1977 the Institute was named after the late Milton Helpern, Chief Medical Examiner from 1954 to 1973. The Institute is comprised of OCME, the New York University School of Medicine, and the New York University College of Dentistry. OCME's headquarters at 520 First Avenue houses executive offices, the mortuary, autopsy rooms, X-Ray/photography facilities, as well as toxicology and histology laboratories.
