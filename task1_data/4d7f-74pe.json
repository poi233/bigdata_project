How do we prepare our children to meet the demands of this ever changing world?  It is clear that they need to become connoisseurs of information.  They must develop the skills to acquire and assess the quality of information that exists in ever increasing amounts.  Technology has become an essential asset for this purpose.  However, technology is expensive to acquire and maintain.  ESMS is committed to providing its students with the requisite skillsets by maintaining and expanding the student access to technology.  Currently, the school has over 200 laptops in 6 carts.  Each classroom has 2 iMacs, a printer, an HDTV and document camera.  Each teacher has their own laptop, which can be also be used to display information on the TVs. The teachers use a lot of digital content in their lessons, and student each have their own Google account.  Schoolwork is done using Google docs, which allows collaboration and paperless submission of student work to the teachers.

Through the program, children gather pennies, make grants and take action to help people and causes that matter to them.  Annually, NYC children make hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants to protect the young and the elderly, support disaster relief and fight disease and defend the environment and human rights.   As children progress through the program, they learn to be responsible citizens, philanthropists and community organizers and leaders.  1) Gathering Pennies:  A school-wide, 4 week fall campaign to gather pennies to earn a $1,000 budget for student grant making.  2) Making Grants:  Student leaders, usually 10-15 students across multiple grades, meet weekly for 16 weeks to represent their school in grant making.  They research and discuss community issues with peers, and community members; identify, interview and visit potential grantees; and ultimately, make funding decisions. Students use research, problem solving, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, and involve the entire student body in their research and decision making.  The $1,000 budget is most often broken into several small grants and service projects (Taking Action). 3) Taking Action: Student leaders organize a volunteer project of their choice, often involving the entire school.  Common Cents staff trains and supports teachers to link service projects with academic lessons, whether it be planting a garden, or planning a community health fair.  We credit our success to the year-round curriculum, training, and support we provide to schools and our commitment to research and innovation.  Common Cents trains an adult facilitator in each school (a Penny Harvest Coach) to work with a group of student leaders to run the year-long program.   We provide over 9 hours of professional development to teachers, as well as on-going assistance via on-site and remote support in order to establish a permanent culture of caring, philanthropy and involvement.

Second Stage has formed relationships with a number of junior and senior high schools throughout the five boroughs that consistently utilize this free service for their students.  A majority of participants attend vocational schools, and this program affords them one of very few opportunties to step outside their concentration.  In addition, many of the students\u2019 parents don\u2019t have the time, money, and/or inclination to take their children to theater so our matinee series gives them an educational experience they would otherwise not have.  This program not only offers students the chance to see live theatre, it also facilitates a comprehensive discussion between students, their teachers, and our artists regarding the themes and issues that are pervasive in the piece.  All participating classrooms receive a study guide, created and provided by Second Stage Theatre, to assist with this lesson.  These study guides are prepared to help the students think critically about the show.  Following each matinee there is a talk-back session with the cast and creative team that is coordinated by the artistic staff at Second Stage Theatre.  This talk-back gives students the chance to ask questions and interact with the actors, playwrights and directors who helped bring the piece to fruition.  This process makes the play relevant to the students\u2019 lives and puts a personal touch on the experience.  The partipants in the Student Matinee Series live throughout the five boroughs of New York City, range in age from 13-19, and come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  The schools we serve include Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn), Baccalaureate School for Global Education (Queens), Cobble Hill High School (Brooklyn), Discovery High School (Bronx), Fashion Industries High School (Manhattan), Graphic Arts High School (Manhattan), Grover Cleveland High School (Queens), Halsey Junior High (Queens), Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis High School (Manhattan), Washington Irving High School (Manhattan), Urban Academy (Manhattan), West Side High School (Manhattan), Boys and Girls Harbor (Manhattan) and Young Women\u2019s Leadership School (Manhattan).  On average, the students from these schools are 14% white, 29% black, 50% Hispanic or Latino, and 7% Asian.  Two-thirds (66%) qualify for free lunches.  Enrollment at these schools ranges from 131-3051 students, with an average of 1,259 students.", "\"Funds will supplement the creation of a student researched, designed and recorded cell phone walking tour highlighting the architecture of Soho.  7th \u2013 9th grade students in the CFA Foundation's summer program will explore the SoHo neighborhood, famous today as a center for art and fashion and home to many of NYC\u2019s beautiful 19th century cast-iron buildings.  Students will uncover the stories these buildings and streets have to tell, and work together to create a cell phone guide to the neighborhood for the general public to enjoy any time of the year.  The Soho tour will be created in conjunction with the Center for Architecture's  \"\"Architecture in Historic Districts\"\" exhibition that will be on display this fall. \"\"Architecture in Historic Districts\"\" will examine the many facets of five of the City\u2019s historic landscape, including Soho. Hardcopy maps of the cell phone tour will be available at the Center for Architecture (within walking distance of Soho) and digital copies will be available on-line for downloading, giving exhibition visitors and the general public the opportunity to broaden their experience of Soho. This project will enable students to be become teachers, sharing their new found knowledge with those interested in learning more about Soho.  The tour will be free and accessible to anyone with a cell phone.  Last year we piloted a student-created cell phone tour focusing on the immigrant history of Bleecker St. that was very well received.  The cell-phone guide curriculum is one of CFAF\u2019s new initiatives that not only teaches students about architecture but informs the general public, making architecture and design of NYC more accessible for all. We hope that this new cell-phone tour will also be well received and pave the way for more to come. We expect an average of 25,000 visitors to the \u201cArchitecture in Historic Districts\u201d exhibit who will also be informed about the tour.

The analysis will focus on Fulton Ferry landing, adjacent to the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn but will also consider Pier 6 as an alternative.Exploring ways to enhance the infrastructure at either Fulton Ferry landing or Pier Six will allow people to access the Brooklyn Bridge Park more easily and will add greater utility to the water ferry service.  Currently, the infrastructure at Fulton Ferry landing only allows for landing of bow loading boats, which generally have a capacity of less than 150 people.  This situation prevents larger excursion ships such as The Circle Line or Harbor Cruises from having access to the landing and this section of Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is poised to become one of the City\u2019s premiere waterfront destinations.The Downtown Brooklyn Partnership worked with the NYC Economic Development Corporations\u2019 Maritime division to prepare a Scope of Work to be completed by a transportation planning consulting firm that will look at the feasibility of remedying this current limiting situation.This study will investigate I.

Astella will collaborate with the NYC Department of Sanitation, the Coney Island Board of Trade, and Mermaid Ave. merchants to provide these services. Members of the Coney Island Board of Trade, in which Astella helped to revitalize and provides technical assistance, have noted that while most merchants keep the sidewalk area in front of their stores free of liter according to city law, additional liter and sidewalk dirt and stains accumulate throughout the remainder of the day. In addition, according to a survey of Mermaid Ave. merchants conducted by an Astella intern in 2010, cleanliness of Mermaid Ave. was cited as the number one concern among merchants on Mermaid Ave. A cleaner commercial corridor will inspire confidence and pride in the neighborhood, provide a welcoming environment for shoppers, a boost for Mermaid Ave. businesses, and sends the message that a clean neighborhood is important to the community and encourages residents and visitors to Mermaid Ave. not to liter and improve overall cleanliness. Astella will engage the services of a power-washing cleaning company to apply high pressure, hot-water power washers to remove tough dirt, stains, and gum on the sidewalk surfaces along Mermaid Ave. In addition, Astella will initiate a pilot program, hiring three Coney Island residents three times a week from May through November to sweep the sidewalks and street corners, and collect and bag refuse, including cans, bottles, food and food wrappers, newspapers, etc. One of those individuals will also serve as a crew supervisor. Once the pilot program proves successful, the program will continue, which will provide ongoing employment to a population that is disproportionately unemployed. These jobs will be a stepping stone to higher paying jobs."], "average_length": 157.19834013571685}}, {"column_name": "Fiscal Conduit Name", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 148, "frequent_values": ["None", "United Activities Unlimited, Inc.", "St. Rosalia-Regina Pacis Neighborhood Improvement Association, Inc.", "Maspeth Town Hall, Inc.", "Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, Inc."], "data_types": {"type": "TEXT", "count": 80609, "shortest_values": ["None", "GALAXY", "Galaxy", "SI-TRAC", "ATLED Inc"], "longest_values": ["Bergen Basin Community Development Corporation d/b/a Millennium Development", "Bergen Basin Community Development Corporation d/ba Millennium Development", "Bergen Basin Community Development Corp, d/b/a Millennium Development", "Bay Ridge Bensonhurst Beautification and Preservation Alliance, Inc.", "Bergen Basin Community Development Corp dba Millennium Develeopment"], "average_length": 4.76307856442829}}, {"column_name": "FC EIN", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 112, "frequent_values": ["None", "112697931", "132921483", "237259702", "113199040"], "data_types": {"type": "TEXT", "count": 80609, "shortest_values": ["None", "Clinton", "30387372", "43780020", "111630780"], "longest_values": ["Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square", "Midtown-Midtown South", "Park Slope-Gowanus", "111630780", "111642720"], "average_length": 4.097941917155652}}, {"column_name": "Borough", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 6, "frequent_values": ["MANHATTAN", "None", "BROOKLYN", "QUEENS", "BRONX"], "data_types": {"type": "TEXT", "count": 80609, "shortest_values": ["None", "BRONX", "QUEENS", "BROOKLYN", "MANHATTAN"], "longest_values": ["MANHATTAN", "STATEN IS", "BROOKLYN", "QUEENS", "BRONX"], "average_length": 6.796523961344267}}, {"column_name": "Latitude", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 5584, "frequent_values": ["None", "40.753612", "40.706251", "40.741828", "40.753475"], "data_types": {"type": "DATE/TIME", "count": 80609, "min_value": "40.753632", "max_value": "40.753632"}}, {"column_name": "Longitude", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 5568, "frequent_values": ["None", "-73.992417", "-74.012952", "-73.907281", "-73.990594"], "data_types": {"type": "DATE/TIME", "count": 80609, "min_value": "-73.991009", "max_value": "40.786591"}}, {"column_name": "Community Board", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 29, "frequent_values": ["None", "1.0", "5.0", "2.0", "3.0"], "data_types": {"type": "REAL", "count": 80609, "min_value": 1.0, "max_value": 95.0, "mean": 6.6599657160667265, "stddev": 7.601040119415183}}, {"column_name": "Council District", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 52, "frequent_values": ["None", "3", "1", "33", "4"], "data_types": {"type": "INTEGER", "count": 80609, "min_value": 1, "max_value": 51, "mean": 20.541347785434912, "stddev": 16.80564430166928}}, {"column_name": "Census Tract", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 1112, "frequent_values": ["None", "109", "9", "95", "21"], "data_types": {"type": "INTEGER", "count": 80609, "min_value": 1, "max_value": 157902, "mean": 5010.251395969956, "stddev": 18740.41993953862}}, {"column_name": "BIN", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 5350, "frequent_values": ["None", "1083624", "1000803", "4454475", "1014454"], "data_types": {"type": "INTEGER", "count": 80609, "min_value": 169, "max_value": 5165197, "mean": 2461552.6383476066, "stddev": 1391323.5372327988}}, {"column_name": "BBL", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 5232, "frequent_values": ["None", "1007860001", "1000200004", "4023137501", "1007870011"], "data_types": {"type": "INTEGER", "count": 80609, "min_value": 0, "max_value": 5080470080, "mean": 2385249570.658337, "stddev": 1345911705.520154}}, {"column_name": "NTA", "number_non_empty_cells": 80609, "number_empty_cells": 0, "number_distinct_values": 195, "frequent_values": ["None", "Midtown-Midtown South", "Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan", "SoHo-TriBeCa-Civic Center-Little Italy", "DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown Brooklyn-Boerum Hill"], "data_types": {"type": "TEXT", "count": 80609, "shortest_values": ["None", "Corona", "Hollis", "Airport", "Astoria"], "longest_values": ["Todt Hill-Emerson Hill-Heartland Village-Lighthouse Hill", "Breezy Point-Belle Harbor-Rockaway Park-Broad Channel", "Mariner's Harbor-Arlington-Port Ivory-Graniteville", "DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown Brooklyn-Boerum Hill", "Soundview-Castle Hill-Clason Point-Harding Park"], "average_length": 16.610874716222753}}], "key_column_candidates": []}
